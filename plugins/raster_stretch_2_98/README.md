RasterStretch applies quick, non-destructive contrast stretching to raster layers using percentile cuts
 (default 2â€“98) or custom values. It works with single-band gray, multiband RGB, and pseudocolor renderers,
 respects source and user NoData, and can compute statistics on the full layer or the current map extent.
 Built for large datasets, it uses sampling (and benefits from overviews) to stay fast, helping you turn raw imagery into clear, usable maps in seconds.
